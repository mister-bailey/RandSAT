# RandSAT
Generates random SAT problems. Runs in a parallel thread. Interfaces with Python. (Used for training SAT solvers.)

## How-to:
Run `python setup.py install` to compile and install the package.
You must have *numpy* installed. You need *Tensorflow* if you want problems to be returned as `SparseTensor`'s.
